    <h1>B. R. Ambedakar</h1>
    <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in Army Cantonment of Mhow, 
	Maharashtra (currently in Madhya Pradesh). His Father Ramji Maloji Sakpal was a Subedar
	in the Indian Army and his mother Ramabai Sakpal was a homemaker.</p>
    <p>He belongs to the Mahar community that was considered an untouchable community at 
	that time. The concept of untouchability affected his school days and college days. 
	Even having a unique persona in studies he suffered discrimination and biased attitude 
	of his teachers, school and college mates. But, these ups and downs in his life gave 
	him strength and he never left his studies.</p>
